  If your workload lives in the AWS major regions, we recommend using [Timescale
  Cloud](/use-timescale/latest/services/). This platform is built and exclusively operated by
  Timescale, designed to offer maximum cost-effectiveness and performance for
  time-series data. If you need Azure or GCP, [Managed Service for TimescaleDB](/mst/latest/)
  is the best choice for you.
